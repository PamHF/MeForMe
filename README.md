  - Synchronized device control (lights, blinds, coffee maker)
  - Real-time monitoring and adjustments

### AI Integration
- **Machine Learning Capabilities**
  - Pattern recognition for daily routines
  - Predictive scheduling
  - Temperature optimization
  - Behavioral adaptation
  - Consistency tracking

### Dashboard Interface
- **Modern Web Interface**
  - Real-time device control
  - Temperature monitoring with historical data
  - Routine management
  - AI insights display
  - Mobile-responsive design

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript
  - Chart.js for data visualization

- **AI/ML**
  - TensorFlow.js
  - Neural Network implementation
  - Pattern recognition algorithms

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-home-ai.git
cd smart-home-ai
```

2. Open `index.html` in your text editor and ensure the following CDN scripts are included:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/3.7.0/chart.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@latest"></script>
```

3. Deploy to your web server or open locally in a browser.

## Usage

### Basic Setup
1. Open the dashboard in your web browser
2. Set your preferred wake-up time
3. Configure device preferences
4. Enable the AI learning system

### AI Learning System
The system will begin learning from your patterns after collecting at least 2 days of data. It analyzes:
- Wake-up times
- Temperature preferences
- Device usage patterns
- Daily routines

### Viewing Insights
- Check the AI Insights card for:
  - Predicted routines
  - Pattern analysis
  - Optimization suggestions
  - Consistency scores
